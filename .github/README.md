# ðŸ”„ MinecraftRemapper

**MinecraftRemapper** is a Java program designed to **decompile** and **remap** the Minecraft game code using the
mappings provided by Mojang. You can use all versions from **1.14** (version where the mapping was proposed by Mojang)
until the **latest**. You can also use **snapshots**.

Typically, decompiling and remapping takes less than 2 minutes and less than 1 minute for the server.

## Usage

Java 17+ must be installed on your machine.

1. Download the jar in the releases section.
2. Created a folder and put the jar inside.
3. Run the jar with the parameters you want.

```bash
java -jar MinecraftRemapper.jar -v 1.20.4 -t client -o out -d
```

`-v 1.20.4` : Specify the version of Minecraft to use.\
`-t client` : Target client or server for decompiling.\
`-o out` : Specify the output directory.\
`-d` : Enable decompilation after remapping; if not set, only the remapped jar is built.\
Use `-l` to show all available versions.
